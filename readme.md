# A simple bash student picker

## Initialize the student list
Run the program with a list (CSV style) of students.
```
$ sh whosnext.sh Yann,Doug,Trouni

>> The new students list: Yann,Trouni,Doug
```

## Pick a student from the list

```
$ sh whosnext.sh
>>
>> The remaining peeps: Yann,Trouni,Doug
>> 
>> And I pick...

```
The list reinitialize itself automatically when there is no students left.

```

$ sh whosnext.sh 2
>>
